# Understanding Explanations Through Visualization

This code is for a project as part of the SPIN (Students Pushing Innovation) internship at NCSA (National Center for Supercomputing Applications). The goal of this portion of the project is to visualize elementary primality proofs of numbers.

### Instructions
Visit [Canvas Visualization] to see the primes visualized on HTML canvas and [SVG Visualization] to see it in SVG (you can download from there). Enter the number desired in the text box and press enter.

### Credits
All code not stated here was all my own work.
The composite factorization diagrams were based on code from Stephen Von Worley's [Animated Factorization Diagrams].
I used code from the D3 JavaScript library for the canvas zooming-in functionality [D3 Zoom].
I used [jsPDF] to generate a PDF from the canvas.

None of this code will be used for commercial benefit, and I will set up a license potentially.
