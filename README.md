# Explanation-Visualization Project

This code is for a project for an internship at NCSA. The goal is to visualize factorization diagrams of numbers.

### Tasks:
* Get code from website to run (DONE)
* Reverse order factorization and diagrams are displayed (DONE)
* Develop a new display style “R = P mod D”, where the remainder R is shown in red, and the divisor D runs from 2 to D_max = ceiling(sqrt(R)), and visually prove that this works.
